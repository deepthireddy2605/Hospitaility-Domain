🌟 Introducing My End-to-End Data Analytics Project! 🏨📊

Hi everyone! I'm excited to share my latest project: Revenue Insights in the Hospitality Domain – a comprehensive, end-to-end data analytics solution designed to unlock business insights for the hotel industry! ✨

🌟 Key Features:
✅ Data Cleaning & Preparation: Ensured data accuracy and consistency to build a reliable foundation for analysis.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovered key trends in occupancy, revenue, customer ratings, and booking behavior.
✅ Interactive Visualization: Developed a professional Power BI dashboard with dynamic filters for city, property, room class, platform, and more.

⚙️ Tech Stack:

Excel / SQL: For initial data preparation and structured querying.

Power BI: To design an interactive and insightful dashboard.

💡 This project gave me hands-on experience in analyzing real-world hospitality data and demonstrated how data-driven decisions can help optimize revenue, enhance occupancy, and improve customer satisfaction. From raw datasets to an interactive dashboard, this project reflects the full lifecycle of data analytics in action.

🙌 Feel free to explore the repository, check out the dashboard, and share your feedback! Your thoughts mean a lot to me.
